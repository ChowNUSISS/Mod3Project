## Assignment

This assignment aims to help the students bridge their HTML knowledge to the use of JSX. There are both similarities and differences between HTML and JSX. As the students practice, they will become more aware and familiar with using JSX. Choose a part of this [page](https://nicepage.com/website-templates/preview/machinery-parks-for-industrial-48832) and replicate it with JSX as much as they can.

For the images, create an assets folder and import the images. This guide will be helpful for the students:[link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39999367/how-do-i-reference-a-local-image-in-react)
